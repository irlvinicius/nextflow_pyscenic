# Transcription Factor Reference Lists

This directory contains transcription factor (TF) reference files used in this project.

The TF lists included here are small, stable reference datasets and are therefore
stored directly in the repository.

Two types of human HGNC-based TF lists are provided:

- `hs_hgnc_tfs.txt`  
  A comprehensive list of human transcription factors based on HGNC annotations.
  This list is broader and may include putative TFs and cofactors.

- `hs_hgnc_curated_tfs.txt`  
  A manually curated, high-confidence list of human transcription factors.
  This list prioritizes specificity and literature support.

These lists serve as biological references and are intended to be used as input
for downstream analyses (e.g., regulatory network inference).
